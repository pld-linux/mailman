save original mime headers from attachment to .raw file and send them back when
attachment is accessed over cgi. as the logistic of saving attachment with
filename is quite unreliable, even if the content-types match for input and
output the filename extension offered may make no sense on client computer.

for example input email has:
Name: test.rtf
Type: application/msword
Size: 17084 bytes

Mailman will detect from mimetype .dot extension:
python -c 'from mimetypes import guess_all_extensions; print guess_all_extensions("application/msword");'
['.wiz', '.dot', '.doc']

and save as test.wiz, client will request such file, and will get:
Content-Type: application/msword

and will save as test.wiz, now client desktop has no ideas how to open .wiz
file and has to rename file manually to .rtf to actually being able top open it
with double click.

saving and sending original headers ensures we get original filename that was
in email. works for private archives but unfortunately as public archives are
sent out direcly by webserver which we have no control over the extra headers
to send. (altho if we mod_asis could work here, but that means totally
incompatible storage from previous versions)
